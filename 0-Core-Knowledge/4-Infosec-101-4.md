> ⚠️ This module is fully theoretical and was extracted from [CEH Study Guide](https://github.com/Samsar4/CEH-v10-Study-Guide/) repo. Here you'll find some basic terms in 'InfoSec world'.


## <u>Security Policies</u>

2. **Procedures** - Set of details steps to accomplish a goal; Instructions for implementation
3. **Guidelines** - Advice on actions given a situation; Recommended, not mandatory

* **Acceptable Use Policy**
  - This defines the acceptable use of system resources.

## Security Policiy - Types
1. **Promiscuous Policy** - This policy usually has no restrictions on usage of system resources.

2. **Permissive Policy** - This policy begins wide open and only know dangerous services/attacks or behaviors are blocked. This type of policy has to be updated regularly to stay effective.

1. Perform a Risk Assessment
2. Use security Standards and Frameworks as guide
3. Get Management and Staff input
4. Enforce the policy. Use penalties for non-compliance
5. Publish final draft to entire org.
6. Have all staff read/sign that they understood policy
