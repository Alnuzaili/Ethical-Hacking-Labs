# <u>Introduction to Information Security & Penetration Testing</u>

> ⚠️ This module is fully theoretical and was extracted from [CEH Study Guide](https://github.com/Samsar4/CEH-v10-Study-Guide/) repo. Here you'll find some basic terms in 'InfoSec world'.


## <u> Information Assurance (IA) </u>
*Refers to the assurance of the Integrity, Availability, confidentiality, and authenticity of information and information systems during usage, processing, storage and transmission of information.*

* **Processes that help achieving IA:**
  - Developing local policy, process, and guidance.
  - Designing network and user authetication strategy.
  - Identifying network vulnerabilities and threats (Vulnerability assessments outline the security posture of the network).
  - Idenfitying problems and resource requirements.
  - Creating plan for identified resource requirements.
  - Applying appropriate IA controls.
  - Performing C&A (Certification and Accreditation) process of information systems helps to trace vulnerabilities, and implement sa fety measures.
  - Providing information assurance training to all personnel in federal and private org.

## <u>Information Security Management Program </u>
*Combination of policies, processes, procedures, standards, and guidelines to establish the required **level of information security.***

- Designed to ensure the business operates in a state of reduced risk.
- It encompasses all organizational and operational processes and participants relevant to information security.

> ⚠️ **IA** focus on risk assessment, mitigation side of things; 
> ⚠️ **InfoSec** focus on actually implementing security measures to safeguard systems.

## <u>EISA - Enterprise Information Security Architecture</u>
*Set of requirements, process, principles, and models that determines the structure and behavior of an organization's information systems.*

* **Goals of EISA**:
  - Help in monitoring and detecting network behaviors
  - Detect and recover from security breaches
  - Prioritizing resources of an organization
  - Help to perform risk assessment of an organization's IT assets.
  - Cost prospective when incorporated in security provisions such as incident response, disaster recovery, event correlation, etc.

## <u>Physical Security Controls</u> 

- **Preventive control**: Deters the actor from performing the threat.
    - e.g: Fence, Server Locks, Mantraps, etc.

- **Detective control**: Recognizes an actor's threat.   
    - e.g: Background check, CCTV.

- **Deterrent control**: Deters the actor from **attempting** the threat.
    - e.g: Warning Sign.

- **Recovery**: Mitigates the impact of a manifested threat.
    - e.g: Backups.

- **Compensating control**: Provides alternative fixes to any of the above functions.


*Most of security controls are preventive phase controls*.

⚠️ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls; Provides redundancy in the event of a control failure. (e.g.: image below)

### Types of  Security Controls

| Description    | Examples                                      |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical**   | Guards, lights, cameras, fire extinguishers, flood protection                     |
| **Administrative** | Training awareness, policies, procedures and guidelines to infosec                 |
| **Technical**    | IDS/IPS, Firewall, Encryption, Smart cards, Access control lists |

| Description  | Examples                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Preventative** | authentication, alarm bells |
| **Detective**    | audits, backups             |
| **Corrective**   | restore operations          |

## <u>Managing the Risk</u>
**Risk** can be defined as a probability of the occurrence of a threat or an event that may damage, or cause loss or have other negative impact either from internal or external liabilities.

### Risk matrix

A **risk matrix** is used during **risk assessment** to define the level of risk by considering the category of **probability or likelihood** against the category of consequence **severity**. 

 - This is a simple mechanism to increase visibility of risks and assist management decision making.

### Risk Management
*Is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.*
